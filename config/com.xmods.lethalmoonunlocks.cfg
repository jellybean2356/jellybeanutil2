[6.3 - Terminal]

## By default LMU tries to fit as many tags as possible into a single line.
## Decrease this value if you want to have a more organized look at the cost of more scrolling depending on the amount of tags you see.
## NOTE: Don't worry about setting it too low. It will always put at least one tag per line. Only if any additional tag would exceed this value it puts a line break.
## Do not set it larger than default unless you are also decreasing font size below.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 49
# Acceptable value range: From 10 to 100
Maximum tag line length = 49

## Override the font size in the Terminal's moon catalog.

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
